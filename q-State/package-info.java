 *
 * Provides the classes defining the behaviors used in the
 * simulations of the classical "game of life" model.
 *
 * In particular, the {@code Initiator} class
 * performs a simulation of such a model.
 *
 * The result of the simulation is a log file containing the information
 * necessary for providing a graphical representation of the steps
 * of the simulation.
